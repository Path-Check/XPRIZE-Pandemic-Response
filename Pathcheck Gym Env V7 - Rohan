I recomomend doing this in a conda environment `conda create -n xprize && source activate xprize` before installing dependencies (it may be conda activate xprize depending on your distribution).\n","\n","3) create a directory, ie `~/context` for this notebook, cd into `~/context` , and run the jupyter backend: `jupyter notebook   --NotebookApp.allow_origin='https://colab.research.google.com'   --port=8888   --NotebookApp.port_retries=0 --no-browser` copy the token into the textbox in `connect to local runtime` in your colab browser.\n","\n","4) run the notebook for the first time, it will git clone and install all dependencies.\n","\n","5) IMPORTANT: to keep this configuration in sync with google colab, end your jupyter notebook session in your terminal (`ctrl+c`), cd into `~/context/covid-xprize`, then run the jupyter command again. This is for the path constants in the notebook to match those on google colab. Once again copy the token and start up google colab. **Make sure to add an identifier to the `LOCAL_RUNTIMES` list so your computer doesn't clone the repo twice or it will make a second copy** \n","\n","### Using Colab Local Runtimes\n","\n","When running the notebook locally in the future, just activate your conda environment, cd into `~/context/covid-xprize`, start the jupyter notebook backend, and paste the token and you're up and running.
